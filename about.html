              <h3>Independent, Creative, Hard Worker & Learner</h3>
              <p>As an independent person, there is never a word of giving up in my dictionary.
                Always to work hard, be responsible for all the tasks that
                I carry out and trying to be creative to find solutions to every problem.
                <br><br>As long as I'm alive, I will continue to learn, because
                <strong>to survive we must adapt and evolve</strong>.
                <br><br><em>"Seek knowledge when you are poor, it will be your treasure.
                  When you are rich, it will be your jewelry."</em></p>

            <h3>Cats Lovers</h3>
            <p>I have a soft soul. As social beings, <strong>we must love and care for every
              living creature</strong>, not only humans, but also animals and the environment
              around us. <br><br>I really love cats, in my opinion cats are the cutest,
              gentlest animals and relieve fatigue after a day of activities.</p>

            <h3>Healthy Lifestyle Lovers</h3>
            <p>I realized that I am no longer young. As a single mom, <strong>I have
              to take care of my physical and mental health</strong>. Because there is more
              responsibility on my shoulders, apart from taking care of myself,
              I also have to take care of my children. <br><br>Good and healthy food
              and drink is important to me. Watching movies at the cinema is also a way to maintain mental health.
              Never stop moving, even if it's just light exercise at home or just going for a morning walk outside.</p>

              <h3>An Adventurer</h3>
              <p><strong>Traveling the world is one way to gain knowledge and life experience</strong>.
                I really like adventure, like visiting new places and learning
                about other cultures in new places. For me the experience of
                visiting a new place is a treasure that I can later pass on to
                my children as a story. I hope to inspire them. And they can adventure
                on their own when they grow up in the future. <br><br>I have a dream to wander abroad.

                  hometown. Leave your country and live a foreign life (in other people's
                  land)."</em></p>

                <h3>Online Shopper</h3>
                <p>In my opinion, <strong>the online marketplace is a solution for people
                  who like simple processes and introvert</strong> like me. I like shopping
                  online the most, because there is no need to go out, it saves fuel
                  and time. <br><br>Sometimes I find satisfaction when I can find cheap goods
                  with good quality.
                <br><br>How about you, do you agree with me?</p>
